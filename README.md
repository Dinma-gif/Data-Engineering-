# README: Pulling Data from PostgreSQL and Inserting into Elasticsearch using Apache Airflow

This notebook demonstrates how to use Apache Airflow to extract data from a PostgreSQL database and insert it into Elasticsearch. We will go through the following steps:

1. Install the necessary libraries.
2. Set up PostgreSQL connection and fetch data.
3. Insert the data into Elasticsearch.
4. Create and run an Airflow DAG to automate the process.
